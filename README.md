# Generalized Linear Model (GLM)


## Getting Started

### Installing Python
To use the script, you will need to install Python 3.6.x and add to path:
- [Python 3.6.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)


### Installing Dependencies
After cloning the project, go to the root directory:

Install the dependent libraries by typing the following in cmd/terminal:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Starting the Script
To run the script, go to the root directory and run `python` in cmd/terminal and type the following in the python console:
```
>>> from glm_main import *
```
*Note: ensure that python refers to Python 3.6.x*

### Running GLM on Regression Dataset (Q2)
To run the GLM on regression dataset [mauna_loa], type the following in the python console:
```
>>> run_Q2()
```


### Running Kernelized GLM on Regression Dataset (Q3)
To run the kernelized GLM on regression dataset [mauna_loa], type the following in the python console:
```
>>> run_Q3()
```


### Running GLM with RBF (Q4)
Type the following in the python console:
```
>>> run_Q4()
```

### Running Greedy Algorithm (Q5)
Type the following in the python console:
```
>>> run_Q5()
```
